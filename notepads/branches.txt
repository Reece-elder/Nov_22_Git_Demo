Main branch - Reserved for Stable Production Builds
Dev branch - Reserved for developer stable builds and hot fixes
Feature branches - Where we implement new code

Branch from Main -> Dev
Dev -> Feature branch

git branch - show me all current branches

git branch <branch name> - Create that branch

git checkout <branch name> - Use that branch 

git push --set-upstream origin <name of branch> - adds this branch to the origin repo

git checkout -b <branch name> - Creates a branch then checks it out

git branch -d <branch name> - Deletes the branch

Exercise - Create a Dev branch and push this branch up to GitHub, off of Dev branch make a feature branch and push up a file of the same name as the feature branch. Do this for 3x features

!! IMPORTANT !! Make sure you checkout back to dev between each push
